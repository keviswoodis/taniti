                <h3>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of 
                    less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky 
                    beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior 
                    that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about 
                    20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated 
                    by fishing or agriculture.</h3>
